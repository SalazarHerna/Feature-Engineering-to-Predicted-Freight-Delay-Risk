# Feature-Engineering-to-Predicted-Freight-Delay-Risk
Engineered logistic and financial features to build a Random Forest model that predicts freight delivery delays using supply chain data. The model enabled risk-based insurance pricing, calculating premiums that balance expected claims, fixed costs, and profit margins.

## Objectives:
- Predict whether a shipment would be **late**, based on information available **at the time of purchase**.
- Calculate a **risk-based insurance premium** that considers:
  - Expected claims
  - Fixed administrative expenses
  - Profit margins

## Feature Engineering Summary
These features added predictive power beyond the raw dataset, aligning with real-world shipment risks and behavior patterns.

| Engineered Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Average Customer Order Value`           | Sales per order, calculated from order item totals.                |
| `Discount Impact`               | Estimated financial impact of discounts on order profitability.             |
| `Order Value per Quantity`      | Normalized order value by quantity to detect order complexity.              |
| `Order Value to Quantity Ratio` | Captures efficiency of value shipped per unit ordered.                      |
| `Avg. Sales per Customer Segment`             | Average sales segmented by customer or product group to reflect priority.   |

## Key Outcomes
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** using both original and engineered features to classify freight delay risk.
- Achieved **63.75% accuracy**, with strong **precision and recall** for late deliveries, making the model a reliable predictor of potential claims.
- Calculated a **personalized insurance premium.
  
## Insights
- **Feature engineering** was central to model success, enhancing model depth and interpretability.
- Predictive features like `Discount Impact` and `Order Value to Quantity Ratio` captured underlying financial and logistic patterns affecting delay risk.
- Insurance premiums increase **linearly with profit loading**, giving actuaries flexibility in balancing profitability with competitiveness.

### Strategic Takeaway
This approach shows that **smart feature engineering combined with machine learning** enables scalable, data-driven insurance pricingâ€”even in complex, logistics-heavy markets.
